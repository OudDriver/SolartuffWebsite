        <p class="description targetTranslateText" id="part1">
            The water heating process starts from the collector panel in the form of a vacuum tube which converts sunlight into heat energy and heats cold water into hot water which can reach 80*C. Thanks to the vacuum tube technology, the hot water is maintained at its hot temperature (anti-heatloss).
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, the hot water will be stored in the water tank through the thermosyphon process, which is the process of circulating hot water to replace cold water. This process continues until all the water in the tank is heated evenly.
            <br><br>
            SolarTuff products adopt the "Indirect System" type, where the use of hot water is not directly from the tank. There is a 30-meter “SUS 316 food-grade” stainless steel pipe embedded in the tank. The water used is water that goes through this pipe so that the temperature in the tank is more stable because it is not mixed with new cold water that enters the tank and causes the temperature to drop in the "Direct System" type.
            <br><br>
            The “Indirect System” also guarantees the use of hot water that is more hygienic and cleaner than the “Direct System” which uses direct tank water where the hot water holding tank is often contaminated with silt and rust deposits that arise with long-term use.

        <strong class="bulletPointsInLetterI targetTranslateText" id="subpart1">I. Water Tank</strong>
        <p class="description targetTranslateText" id="part21">
            Consists of 2 layers, namely the inner tank layer and the outer tank layer.
            <br><br>
            The inner layer is made of food-grade SUS 304 stainless steel which is rust-resistant and can withstand high temperatures, ensuring long-term use without the risk of leakage.
            <br><br>
            The outer layer is made of galvanized iron which is resistant to rust, rain, and the sun heat. The use of this material also enhances the overall appearance of the SolarTuff tank.
            <br><br>
            Between the inner and outer layers of this tank, there is a layer of polyurethane foam with a thickness of 55 mm from the Bayer brand made in Germany which is injected using a High-Pressure Injection" machine which functions to maintain the temperature of the hot water in the tank for 72 hours.
            <br><br><br><br>

        <strong class="bulletPointsInLetterI targetTranslateText" id="subpart2">II. Solar Collector Panel</strong>
        <p class="description targetTranslateText" id="part22">
            This is the main component of solar energy absorbers. Made of Borosilicate glass (class pyrex glass) which is very resistant to impact and heat from the sun. The type of glass tube used by SolarTuff is "Amethyst Glass Tube" which is the highest grade that can absorb solar energy more optimally which is undoubtedly the best vacuum glass tube in its class.
            <br><br>
            Using 3 layers of "Nano Absorber Layer" technology, namely Aln - Aln / SS  - Cu , this layer plays an important role in absorbing sunlight and converting it into heat energy.
            <br><br>
            The most difficult manufacturing process of vacuum tubes is vacuum tube vacuuming, so that there is a vacuum between the 2 layers of glass. This is the key to why vacuum tubes can prevent heat loss, due to the absence of a heat-conducting medium in the tube.
            <br><br>
            No less important than this vacuum tube is its round shape which clearly provides more advantages over solar heating using flat panels. Sunlight can be absorbed optimally throughout the morning, afternoon, and evening.
